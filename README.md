#SVG Canvas Room Creator
Room creator is created in an attempt to import SVG assets in a 2D canvas. The tool could help in aligning many layers of assets and in the future output a JSON or a specific output format to help with modeling a game room.
Future work could be to create a version of a locked canvas of this application. Some features it currently have is mouse tracking to allow a 2D player model to change directions. This work is currently at pause due to a change of direction toward electronics.
